Hello!

I'm @sphinxbard, I'm a computer engineering student with a soft corner for C++ (always. No language can ever take its place. Ever.) 
This is an introductory repository to help me get started, you can ignore this, or come say hi :) 
I hate front end development with every fibre of my being; I'll take a problem which I'll wrack my brains over for three days over creating a pReTtY aNd sHiNy webpage any day. 

Tbh, my core interest is not coding at all :D I like writing, reading, drawing portraits, photography, playing the guitar, singing(in the bathroom) and cooking. You can check out my writing at https://magicquill17.wordpress.com/ and my art & photography at https://sighlensessketchbooks.wordpress.com/

I like learning new things, be it physics or mythology. Coding provides me an intellectual challenge and my school teacher had a big hand in developing my interest in it, so I guess that's why I'm here. 

That's all for now, ciao!
